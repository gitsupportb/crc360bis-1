# 🔧 FILE BROWSER ISSUE FIXED
## BCP Securities Services - Reporting Dashboard

**Date:** May 27, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETELY FIXED - NO MORE FAKE FILES

---

## 🎯 **ISSUE RESOLVED**

**Problem:** The file browser was showing fake/sample files even though the folders were empty after cleanup.

**Root Cause:** The file manager was generating simulated file structures with fake files instead of checking actual folder contents.

**Solution:** Completely removed all fake file generation and updated the file browser to show only real files.

### **3. Enhanced Empty State Display**
